The following schematic helps us create an objective viewpoint of two quad sets of colors. we will try are best to rate the pairs based on these four criterias. each Critera has a weighted percentage, which will allow us to have a more objective final score

Relative Neutrality (20%): Is one or both sets neutral in color, or are they both vibrant? Neutral colors can provide balance and versatility in color combinations.
Complementary Colors (25%): Does the selection of colors from one set complement or contrast effectively with colors from the other set? This criterion evaluates the presence of complementary or harmonious color pairs.
User Preference (30%): This criterion considers the subjective preferences of users. Collect feedback from a diverse group of individuals to understand which color combinations they find most aesthetically appealing
